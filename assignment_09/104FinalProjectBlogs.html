                <h2>5 Free Agents the Dodgers Should Target</h2>
                <div class = "blogcontent">
                    <p>The Dodgers' disappointing finish to the 2022 season highlighted the Dodgers'
                        offensive woes and shaky bullpen. Justin Turner seems to be on his last legs, 
                        and Chris Taylor had his worst season as a Dodger yet. The Dodgers' financial 
                        strength, as well as around $100 million in payroll coming off the books, will 
                        allow them to be players with every big free agent. Here are 5 free agents I 
                        believe the Dodgers should target to help them get over the hump in 2023.</p>

                <h2>The 2022 Dodgers are the Most Disappointing Team of All-Time</h2>
                <div class = "blogcontent">
                    <p>This is going to be a rant. It may not be well-written or analytically driven, but I 
                        just don't care enough at this point. This Dodgers team won a franchise-record 111 
                        games to lose to an 89-win Padres team that the Dodgers owned during the regular 
                        season. I mean they absolutely dominated the Padres. But guess what, the regular 
                        season means jack come the postseason. Every team starts 0-0, and the Padres were 
                        the better team in this series. They hit 1-9, played great defense, and got hits when 
                        it mattered. The Dodgers decided that hitting with RISP just didn't matter to them. 
                        They decided that playing good defense didn't matter. They decided that even showing a 
                        little bit of fight didn't matter.</p>

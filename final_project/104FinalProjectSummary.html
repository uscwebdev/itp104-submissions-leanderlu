            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>My final project is based on my favorite sport, baseball. The idea of this page was to give
                to give the average person an insight to baseball, by having basic information in the teams
                page and also being able to search up the roster of any team. Furthermore, I also have the 2023
                season standings listed so there is an idea of which teams are stronger than others. Finally, I have
                a blogs section which is currently linked to my own blog, DodgerNerds. If you click on the title, it will
                redirect you to my DodgerNerds website.

            <h2>Add-Ons</h2>
            <p>In this project I chose Responsive Web Design and JavaScript as my two extras. For the Responsive
                Web Design, I chose to make the menu vertical instead of horizontal when the screen got smaller and 
                changed my content from display:flex to display:inline-block to make everything vertical instead of
                horizontal. The search bar I have is connected to a public API I got from RapidAI. I created a function
                to use Ajax to first connect to the API and then find the full names of each player and return them
                in two rows, as there are around 40 names per roster. The API returned respones in JSON format so I just
                found the name in each object and returned it. When using this search bar, please type the full city and
                teamname (not case sensitive). For example, "Los Angeles Dodgers" or "New York Yankees". Here is a link to
                the API Documentation: <a href = "https://rapidapi.com/sparior/api/baseball4/" target = "_blank">API Documentation</a>.

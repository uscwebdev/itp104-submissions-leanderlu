                        <h2 id = "team">Best Teams</h2>
                            <p>The best teams currently in the MLB are the
                                Los Angeles Dodgers, Atlanta Braves, and Baltimore
                                Orioles. These teams have a strong combination of
                                being able to get on base and hit for power, as well
                                as having strong starting pitching and reliable bullpen
                                arms.</p>
                            <p>While the Dodgers and Braves have a mix of new, young talent and
                                old savvy veterans, the Orioles have graduated their loaded farm
                                talent which has led to their recent succes. While the teams may be
                                different, they do one thing the same: win.</p>
                        </div>
                    <img src = "aaronjudge.jpg" alt = "judge">
                    <div id = "BestPlayers">
                        <h2 id = "player">Best Players</h2>
                        <p>The best players currently in baseball are Mookie Betts, Aaron Judge,
                            Ronald Acuna Jr, Mike Trout, and Freddie Freeman. These players are both elite
                            on both offense and defense. Mookie and Freeman are both gold glove winners and
                            Trout, Judge and Acuna have all graded as top tier defenders. Still, there is one
                            player above the rest.</p>
                        <p>This player is Shohei Ohtani. Ohtani is doing something that hasn't been
                            done since Babe Ruth, which is hitting and pitching at both an elite level. 
                            This year, Ohtani leads the league in both homeruns and on-base plus slugging. Last
                            season, he was 3rd in Cy-Young voting. Ohtani is easily the best player in baseball
                            and most likely the most talented player of all-time.</p>

                    <div id = "WorldSeriesPrediction">
                        <h2 id = "WS">World Series Prediction</h2>
                        <p>As of now, it seems that the World Series will be coming down to the
                            three teams mentioned above, which are the Dodgers, Braves, and Orioles.
                            The Dodgers and Braves are both in the National League, so it is possible that
                            one will have to eliminate the other in order to reach the World Series. The
                            American League is weaker this year which makes the Orioles path to the 
                            World Series easier, though the Astros, Mariners, and Rangers are all strong teams.
                        </p>
                        <p>Even with all this talent, I believe that the Braves will win the World Series. They
                            are a team without a weakness. They have the best offense in baseball and one of if not
                            the best starting rotation as well. Their bullpen isn't elite, but it is solid
                            enough for them to be my World Series favorites.</p>
